# Data Science Exercises

## Description of Task1.ipynb
Creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

###  Solution Overview

Created a synthetic dataset of 500 individuals with the following variables:

- `Age` (continuous)
- `Gender` (categorical)
-  Visualizations:
    - Histogram: Age Distribution
    - Bar Chart: Gender Distribution

## Description of Task2.ipynb
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset (Titanic). Explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.

### Solution Overview

- Cleaned missing values in `Embarked` and `Cabin`
- Visualized:
  - Survival Count
  - Survival by Gender
  - Survival by Passenger Class
  - Age Distribution by Survival
  - Correlation Matrix

### Solution Overview

- Encoded categorical features
- Split data into train/test
- Trained a decision tree classifier
- Evaluated model (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Visualized: The decision tree

## Tools Used
